I'll create a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) and Functional Requirements Document (FRD) with tables for a Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) Detection Application tailored to Medicare/Medicaid services.

## Business Requirements Document (BRD)

### Executive Summary

The FWA Detection Application aims to identify, analyze, and prevent fraudulent activities within Medicare and Medicaid claims processing. This solution will leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to detect suspicious patterns, reduce financial losses, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Business Objectives

- Reduce Medicare/Medicaid fraud by at least 30% within the first year of implementation
- Decrease claim processing time by 25% through automated fraud detection
- Improve accuracy of fraud detection by 40% compared to current methods
- Achieve ROI of 200% within 18 months of deployment
- Ensure 100% compliance with healthcare regulations and standards

### Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------------|------|------------------|
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services | Primary Client | Final approval, funding, compliance oversight |
| Healthcare Providers | End Users | Submit claims, respond to fraud inquiries |
| Claims Processing Team | End Users | Review flagged claims, make determinations |
| Fraud Investigation Unit | End Users | Investigate potential fraud cases |
| IT Department | Support | System maintenance and technical support |
